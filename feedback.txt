-5 cSymbol* cSymbolTable::GetSymbol(string name) is not correct. If you call it for a symbol not in the table, the effect will be to place that symbol into the table.

-2 std::list<cSymbolTable> tableList; is a global variable. It should have been an instance variable of a class that represents your complete symbol table.

-10 Your g_SymbolTable represents a single symbol table. It should represent a stack of symbol tables.

-10 You did not implement the global lookup as required by the write-up

Your git repository contained object files and the executable. It should only contain source.

-5 you reported an apostrophe as a '.' instead of as a JUNK_TOKEN.

For rules that do not return, you should have a code snippet that shows you intentionally did nothing. {} will work.
